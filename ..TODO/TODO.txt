import session to unload tabs immediately

Give back group color (like it was before)


- When a pinned tab refreshes, it constantly blinks red. Suggest changing that to match Firefox's solid little blue indicator. It's less eye-catching (annoying) and more consistent.

folders collapsed by default or make this optional


when actived tab located in folder, all tabs operation related with creating new tab (such as clone of tab in folder, new tab) must work only in current folder.


separate option for close folder (close or promote children)
menu: unload tabs in folders

menu: unload tabs must close real FF tabs, but your tabs must markeds like unloads and stay in list.

Also all your tabs you can save in special folder of FF bookmarks and working from this place, where subdirs first level = groups for tab in left... Option for set base bookmark dir for addon can add to addon config.

Whilst themes are apparently available, i couldn't just grab one via a drop-down which would make it easier.
Accept BCH (BitcoinCash) donations as the FEES make it FAR more palatable to donate (a few cents vs a few dollars). I bet you're missing out on plenty of micro donations because Bitcoin fees are so high it's no longer micro, and ETH is too high too (though not as bad).

- I also support the suggestion of integrating Tree Tabs with Firefox sync. I definitely would have a great use for this possibility.
- Like many other commenters suggested, it would be wonderful to see some indication of the container a tab was opened in, if any. Getting an option to directly be able to chose to open a new tab in a container would also be very useful. 



Option to change the color of the icon indicating that a tab is a source of audio. (separated for playing and muted)






I DON'T UNDERSTAND THOSE FROM COMMENTS
- add possibility open all tabs in folder in new left tab group with deleting this folder;
- for economy memory your tabs must to makings (html code) during activating left tab group or during unfold folders/trees;
- real FF tabs must creating and linking only after activate your tabs;
