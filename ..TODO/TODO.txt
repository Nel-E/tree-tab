- When a pinned tab refreshes, it constantly blinks red. Suggest changing that to match Firefox's solid little blue indicator. It's less eye-catching (annoying) and more consistent.

folders collapsed by default or make this optional

Whilst themes are apparently available, i couldn't just grab one via a drop-down which would make it easier.
Accept BCH (BitcoinCash) donations as the FEES make it FAR more palatable to donate (a few cents vs a few dollars). I bet you're missing out on plenty of micro donations because Bitcoin fees are so high it's no longer micro, and ETH is too high too (though not as bad).

- I also support the suggestion of integrating Tree Tabs with Firefox sync. I definitely would have a great use for this possibility.
- Like many other commenters suggested, it would be wonderful to see some indication of the container a tab was opened in, if any. Getting an option to directly be able to chose to open a new tab in a container would also be very useful. 


I don't understand those from comments
- add possibility open all tabs in folder in new left tab group with deleting this folder;
- for economy memory your tabs must to makings (html code) during activating left tab group or during unfold folders/trees;
- real FF tabs must creating and linking only after activate your tabs;
